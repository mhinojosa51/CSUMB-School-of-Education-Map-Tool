# CSUMB School of Education Map Tool
A map tool I made for the School of Education at CSUMB.
I was asked by our departments database administrator to 
create a tool for our students, staff and faculty to determine
the distance from our campus to our various partner districts
where our student teachers spend the first part of their day. 
The tool lets users input a desired radius around our campus and 
is informed of which of our partner schools are within that area. 
It also gives students directions and drive times. The tool is written
in Google Script on the backend to pull Lat/Lng data for our partner districts
and leverages the Google Maps API on the front-end.
